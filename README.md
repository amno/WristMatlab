# WristMatlab
Simple code to process image using matlab as wrist x-ray dicom image as case example.

This space is my PhD works repository. Many files here are purely experimental. 
Files and Folders are still not in a good arrangement yet.
At the moment, this space has not captured all of my works yet but will progressively be updated later. 

Several publications have produced based on works in this space: 
1.  A. Ananda, K. M. Knapp, A. Appelboam, E. Alonso and C. C. Reyes-Aldasoro, 'Digital Image Analysis of Distal Radius Fractures X-Ray for Manipulation under Anaesthesia', Poster session, in the 23rd Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) conference, Jul.2019.
2.  A. Ananda, C. Karabağ, A. Ter-Sarkisov, E. Alonso, and C. C. Reyes-Aldasoro, ‘Radiography Classification: A Comparison between Eleven Convolutional Neural Networks’, in 2020 Fourth International Conference on Multimedia Computing, Networking and Applications (MCNA), Oct. 2020, pp. 119–125. doi: 10.1109/MCNA50957.2020.9264285.
