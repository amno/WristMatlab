# Wrist Fractures Analysis as observed with X-ray imaging
This space is a space to save my research study to process X-ray images using Matlab as wrist x-ray dicom image as case example.

The title of my submitted PhD thesis is **Wrist Fractures Analysis as observed with X-ray imaging**.

This space is my PhD works repository. Many files here are purely experimental. 
Files and Folders are still not in a good arrangement yet.
At the moment, this space has not captured all of my works yet but will progressively be updated later. 

Several publications have been produced based on works saved in this space: 
1.  A. Ananda, K. M. Knapp, A. Appelboam, E. Alonso and C. C. Reyes-Aldasoro, 'Digital Image Analysis of Distal Radius Fractures X-Ray for Manipulation under Anaesthesia', Poster session, in the 23rd Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) conference, Jul.2019.

The Wrist X-ray images were taken from the MURA data set that could be accessed publicly but by request. This data set has published its information in an article as citation below:
